# PRBMath







*Common mathematical functions used in both PRBMathSD59x18 and PRBMathUD60x18. Note that this shared library does not always assume the signed 59.18-decimal fixed-point or the unsigned 60.18-decimal fixed-point representation. When it does not, it is explicitly mentioned in the NatSpec documentation.*
